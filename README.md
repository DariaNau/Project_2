## Introduction - the project's aim
This app was developed with the idea to help other learn code in a modern and simple way. The app allows two types of users: instructors and students. Both users share the same platform. The app is designed so that users (instrutors) looking to showcase and practice their skills can post a class that they know that they can teach others. The other users (students) would be able to browse through classes posted by the users registered as instructors.

The app has a an area with commonly used resourses that can be accessed by a click.
